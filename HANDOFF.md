# Guardian Angela v3 — Session Hand-off

**Snapshot:** 2026-06-08 — **M0 + M1 COMPLETE+VERIFIED+PUSHED. M2 IN
PROGRESS: #13a + #13b + #14 + #13c (+ #13c-fix cohort loop) done +
committed (UNPUSHED). Next: #13d, #23, #20 → M2 cohort → push.**

The M1 stack was already pushed before this session (the previous handoff was
written pre-push; `origin/main` = `b62ba2b`). M2 builds the configuration UIs.
**The M2 commits are UNPUSHED on local `main`**, by design — M2 pushes as
one milestone after the verifier cohort (rule 12 + plan §3.7):

- `8f74423` m2-#13a — extract shared `EventSpecificConfig` + `step_helpers`
- `b557f98` m2-#13b — rebuild Mode Editor chain (per-step `StepConfigPanel`)
- `11473ba` m2-#14 — SMS contact-selection grid
- `f40baba` m2-handoff (prior session boundary)
- `d54b986` m2-#13c — Mode Editor Safety Options
- `<this>`   m2-#13c-fix — cohort findings (local-template Add + test gaps)
- (+ this handoff commit)

**Tests: 3740 pass** (3728 prior + 12 net-new #13c-fix behavioral tests).
Analyzer `--fatal-infos` clean. l10n parity green (54 #13c keys × 14 locales:
the 53 from #13c + `safetyOptionsAddTemplate` from #13c-fix). Tree clean.
Branch: `main`. (Pure-Dart UI+tests fix — no native path touched, so
host/widget tests are the proof; emulator boot-smoke not re-run.)

**#13c cohort loop:** #13c (`d54b986`) was reviewed by the verification
cohort → **FIX_REQUIRED**, now **FIXED** in `<this>`. Findings addressed:
C1 (the missing `[+ Add Template]` affordance for mode-local templates — see
KEY FINDINGS) + T1–T6 (behavioral test gaps that were green-but-unwired:
manage-link navigation, distress-trigger edit/remove, GPS-arrival radius at a
non-default value, inherit-clears for Stealth/Event-defaults + a two-slot
base-preservation test, GPS-logging inline-field round-trip, and Local
Templates remove + add).

## How to resume

After `/clear`, paste:

> Continue from HANDOFF.md

**Next action: continue M2 — #13d (save validation), then #23, #20,
then the M2 cohort + push.** Per-fix recipe (unchanged): verify the gap
yourself → implement (serial) → prove (host/widget tests driving the REAL
controller; emulator for native) → l10n deltas → language agent for 13
locales → gate suite → commit → **ask before pushing**.

**M2 remaining chunks (the spine — #13a/#13b/#14 — AND #13c — are done):**

1. **#13d — save validation + trigger save-validation** (spec 04:1595-1599,
   1656-1659): name required min 2 chars; chain ≥1 step; distress variant
   non-blocking warn if no SMS/call step; GPS-arrival `fixed` source requires
   lat/lng; hardware-button trigger pattern/pressCount/duration consistency.
   **#13c context:** the editor's `_save()` currently saves unconditionally
   (no validation, no `_AddStepSheet`-style blocking). The Safety Options
   fields #13c added are the targets of trigger save-validation — GPS-arrival
   `fixed` lat/lng (UI lets you leave them blank → `lat/lng = null`), and the
   hardware-button distress trigger (pattern↔pressCount/duration is already
   normalised on edit by `_triggerWithPattern`, but a defensive save-time
   check matches spec). Validate `_draft` in `_save()`; surface name/chain
   errors as blocking, the distress no-action-step warning as non-blocking.
2. **#23 — Alarm settings section** (spec 06:271-296): DND-override / gradual
   / ramp toggles. Verify the gap vs the loudAlarm `EventSpecificConfig`
   (built in #13a) and M0 #19 (gradual + DND already wired in the strategy);
   this is the Settings-level section (06), distinct from per-step config.
3. **#20** — channel-validation-on-save; SMS message-template editor (the
   `messageTemplate` field is in `SmsContactConfig` but has no editor yet);
   iOS SMS+callEmergency warning strings; the missing iOS `critical_alert.wav`.

Then: **M2 verifier cohort** (architect-reviewer spec-vs-code + qa-expert
spec-vs-tests, both `opus`) → gate → **ask the user to push the M2 stack.**

## What's done this session (M2 spine — UNPUSHED)

- **#13a** (`8f74423`): pure refactor — moved the 9 per-type `StepConfig`
  forms + shared field editors out of `event_defaults_screen.dart` into a
  reusable public `EventSpecificConfig`
  (`lib/features/modes/widgets/event_specific_config.dart`) + added
  `step_helpers.dart` (`stepIcon`/`stepDescription`/`stepName`).
  EventDefaultsScreen consumes both. 58 event_defaults tests unchanged-green.
- **#13b** (`b557f98`): **per-step-config half of GA-blocker #13.** Mode
  Editor chain is now a `SliverReorderableList` of expandable step tiles;
  each expands inline to `StepConfigPanel` (3 collapsible groups: Timing /
  Event configuration via `EventSpecificConfig` / Retry & Advanced). A null
  config displays resolved `AppDefaults.eventDefaults` and materialises on
  first edit (spec 04:1541). Per-step Reset/Duplicate/Delete (Delete disabled
  at 1 step); drag-to-reorder re-indexes `order`; categorised Add-Step picker
  with localized names. New shared `config_fields.dart`
  (Int/Double/Enum/Text editors). 31 mode-editor widget tests (drive the real
  screen→draft→DB flow incl. a reorder-drag test). Emulator boot-smoke green.
- **#14** (`11473ba`): **GA-blocker #14.** smsContact config renders an
  `SmsContactGrid` (one FilterChip per contact) — Mode Editor context only
  (`EventSpecificConfig.contacts != null`; null in Event Defaults).
  Channel-incapable contacts greyed/unselectable. Toggle re-infers selection;
  **all-capable selected → `allContacts` with `contactIds = null`** (a
  non-null id list under `allContacts` is read as *specific IDs* by the
  runtime resolver — see KEY FINDINGS). Empty repo → deep-link to `/contacts`.
  8 grid tests (incl. the null-contactIds inference) + a mode-editor
  integration test.
- **#13c** (`<this>`): **Safety Options half of GA-blocker #13.** Collapsible
  "Safety options" `ExpansionTile` at the bottom of the editor
  (`lib/features/modes/widgets/safety_options_section.dart`), wired to the
  editor's in-memory `_draft` via a new `_updateDraft(SessionMode)` mutator.
  Sub-parts, all driving `_draft`→DB on Save: distress-mode picker (writes
  `distressModeId`; hidden in distress variant; "Use default" names the
  resolved default mode) + "Manage distress modes" link; distress-triggers
  list (add/edit/remove `HardwareButtonDistressTrigger`, pattern↔count/dur
  normalised on edit); disarm-triggers (GPS-arrival toggle+radius slider
  50m–5km+destination-source+fixed lat/lng; timer toggle+5min–8h slider);
  GPS-logging tri-state (Inherit/Custom/Off) with inline `GpsLoggingFields`;
  stealth tri-state with inline `StealthConfigFields`; mode-local templates
  list (remove + "Manage reminder templates" link); event-defaults tri-state
  (Inherit/Custom) with inline `ModeEventDefaults`; `allowDisarmAsDistress`
  toggle (distress variant only, G-014). Distress variant's `_AddStepSheet`
  omits the check-in category (spec 04:1649). `InfoIconButton`s throughout
  (now localized — `commonGotIt`). New controller-free field widgets
  `gps_logging_fields.dart` / `stealth_config_fields.dart` /
  `mode_event_defaults.dart` mirror the standalone screens. 20 widget tests
  (real screen→draft→DB, incl. override-clearing round-trip, fixed-source
  lat/lng, RTL-expanded render). 53 new l10n keys × 14 locales. Emulator
  boot-smoke green.

## KEY FINDINGS (carry into the next session)

- **`ModeOverrides.localTemplates` is LIVE, not legacy.**
  `session_controller.dart:495-500` merges `...?mode.overrides?.localTemplates`
  into the effective reminder-template pool a `disguisedReminder` draws from.
  The #13c-fix cohort flagged a possible "is this legacy?" ambiguity; the
  tripwire was checked and CLEARED — it is consumed at runtime, so the
  `[+ Add Template]` affordance (spec 04:1613) was implemented, not skipped.
- **Mode-local template Add reuses a shared form, NOT the global editor
  screen.** The global `TemplateEditorScreen._save()` is hardwired to upsert
  `isGlobal: true` straight to the DB and `context.pop()` with no return value
  — unusable for a draft-staged, `isGlobal: false`, not-yet-persisted local
  template. Refactored the form body out into a reusable, DB/router-free
  `ReminderTemplateForm` (`lib/features/template_editor/reminder_template_form.dart`,
  exposes `buildTemplate({existing, isGlobal})`). `TemplateEditorScreen` now
  composes it (global path unchanged — its existing tests stay green); the mode
  editor's `_LocalTemplatesEditor` opens it in a `fullscreenDialog`
  `MaterialPageRoute<ReminderTemplate>` and stages the result (`isGlobal: false`,
  `isCustom: true`) into `_draft` via the existing `_modeWithLocalTemplates`
  plumbing — nothing hits the DB until the mode itself is saved.
- **Contact channel field is `channels`** (not `messageChannels` as some spec
  prose says). SMS-capable = `contact.channels.contains(config.channel)`.
- **`allContacts` + non-empty `contactIds` ⇒ treated as SPECIFIC IDs** by
  `sms_contact_strategy.dart:135` (legacy back-compat). So true "all" MUST
  null `contactIds`. `SmsContactConfig.copyWith` (and `ChainStep.copyWith`)
  CANNOT null a field (`x ?? this.x`) — construct the object directly to clear.
- **`EventSpecificConfig` is shared** (Mode Editor + Event Defaults). It keeps
  the existing `eventDefaults*` l10n keys (context-neutral). The smsContact
  grid only shows when `contacts != null`.
- **Mode-editor widget-test harness:** override `databaseProvider` (real
  in-memory `GuardianAngelaDatabase.memory`) + `appSettingsRepositoryProvider`
  (`_FakeAppSettingsRepository` returning `const AppSettings()`). Seed
  contacts via `db.contactsDao.upsert(...)`.
- **`flutter gen-l10n` after ARB edits** regenerates `app_localizations*.dart`
  (zh_TW is folded into `app_localizations_zh.dart` as `AppLocalizationsZhTw`).
  This session's regen diffs were additions-only (no blank-line drift). Keep
  them.
- **`copyWith` cannot null applies to `SessionMode.overrides` ITSELF, not just
  inner fields.** `_modeWithOverrides` must DIRECT-CONSTRUCT the SessionMode to
  set `overrides = null` — `mode.copyWith(overrides: _normalised(...))` silently
  KEEPS the stale overrides when `_normalised` returns null (the Inherit-clears
  path). A widget test (`Custom then Inherit clears the override`) caught this
  live; same trap as `distressModeId`. Likewise `ModeOverrides.copyWith` can't
  null an inner field → build `ModeOverrides(...)` directly + a `_normalised`
  helper that returns null when all four override slots are empty (so an
  all-inherit mode persists `overrides = null`, not an empty object).
- **Tri-state ⇄ override mapping:** Inherit = override field null; Custom = a
  config (force `enabled: true` so a previously-Off config flips on); Off =
  config with `enabled: false`. Event-defaults is two-state only (Inherit =
  null / Custom = `const EventDefaults()`).
- **Translation ARB edits must be TEXT-INSERTED, not `json.load`/`json.dump`.**
  Re-serialising reflows the existing collapsed `@`-metadata `placeholders`
  blocks → dozens of spurious deletions (violates additions-only). Insert the
  new `"k": "v",` lines before the file's final `}` and add a trailing comma to
  the prior last entry (the only existing line that changes: `-1 +N+1` per
  file). Placeholder tokens (`{button}`, `{count}`, `{km}`, …) stay inline; no
  `@`-metadata needed in the 13 translation ARBs (only `app_en.arb` carries it).
- **`InfoIconButton` is now localized** (`commonGotIt`) and needs
  `AppLocalizations.of(context)` — it had a hard-coded English "Got it".
- **Dropdown-open in widget tests:** tap the dropdown's CURRENT VALUE text (e.g.
  `safetyOptionsDestinationPrompt`), not the `InputDecorator` label — the label
  doesn't open the menu. Then tap the target item `.last` (overlay copy).

---

## DEFERRED — M2 polish (NOT stubs; fold into the listed chunk)

- **Per-field info-icon buttons + preview cards on `EventSpecificConfig`**
  (fakeCall/smsContact/loudAlarm), spec 04:1538. STILL deferred — #13c added
  info buttons to the Safety-Options SECTIONS (distress/disarm/GPS/stealth/
  templates/event-defaults), not to the individual per-step event-config
  FIELDS inside `EventSpecificConfig`, nor the 3 preview cards. Batch all the
  per-field explanation strings into ONE language-agent run → a #13 polish pass.
- **Localized one-sentence step descriptions.** `step_helpers.stepDescription`
  is still English; `event_defaults_screen` still uses `type.name` titles +
  English descriptions. Localize `stepDescription` (add `chainStepDesc*` keys)
  and switch event_defaults to `stepName(l10n,…)` titles — **update the
  event_defaults test's `_tileName` accordingly.**
- **Mode icon selector** (spec 04:1487). `SessionMode.iconName` is unwired;
  needs a name↔IconData map (tree-shake-safe, no `Icons` reflection).
- **"Reset to defaults" resets config only, not timing** — no per-type
  timing-default source in `EventDefaults`; the spec's "Config Defaults" para
  is config-scoped, so this is defensible. Revisit if a timing-reset is wanted.
- **Per-type collapsed-header summary** ("30s ring, 5s grace"; "To: Alice,
  Bob") — the tile subtitle currently shows the generic `stepTimingSummary`.
- **`blackScreenMode` placement:** lives in the Event-config group
  (inside `EventSpecificConfig`), not Retry & Advanced as spec 04:1539/1561
  lists. Moving it generically needs a `StepConfig.copyWithBlackScreen` or a
  per-type switch — deferred to avoid model surgery. Minor.
- **Grid summary "+N more" truncation** — currently lists all selected names.

---

## DEFERRED — earlier milestones (unchanged from prior handoffs)

- **#11/#12 device E2E → M5** (adb-gsm call; background-throttle). Host tests
  + the real `flutter/lifecycle` platform message are the proof for the wiring.
- **#22 GPS:** `GpsLoggingConfig.accuracy` resolved but not applied
  (protocol has no accuracy param; Real hardcodes high — default is high, so
  no discrepancy). `includeInSms`/`format`/`historyRetentionDays` resolved +
  persisted but unconsumed at runtime → M2 spec-cleanup OR honour at runtime.
- **Background full-screen launch-to-route** (notification full-screen-intent →
  FakeCall/DisguisedReminder when locked) → a notification-deeplink nav pass.
- **#18 polish:** tapWord decoy words not localized; disguise icon is a neutral
  Material icon (template `iconAsset`/`imagePath` not rendered). → near #15.
- **iOS `critical_alert.wav`** missing from the iOS bundle → fold into #20.
- **`docs/review/remaining-gaps.md`** is a STALE v2-era artifact — do NOT
  action against v3.

## Decisions made (all via AskUserQuestion, prior sessions)

1. Approve remediation plan + milestone order; M0 first.
2. Tier-F descope → decide at M4.
3. R-8 emergency-number data → citable public reference + user review (M4).
4. #17 → full-screen auto-appear. 5. #18 fullScreen → pushed route.
6. Verify each milestone (cohort) + push the verified stack before the next.
7. #22 battery-alert DESCOPED → feature removed entirely (GPS-logging-only).

*(M2 spine implementation choices — three-group panel, grid inference,
sharing EventSpecificConfig, the deferred-polish list — were spec-driven, not
user decisions, so they live under "What's done" / "DEFERRED".)*

---

## Hard rules (unchanged — apply every stage)

1. **OLD/ is INERT.** Never read/list/glob/grep/import under `OLD/`.
   `git checkout HEAD -- OLD/` if a tool dirties it.
2. **NO STUBS at GA** (S-1..S-12 in `~/.claude/plans/make-sure-that-there-typed-tulip.md §NO-STUBS`).
3. **NO INVENTED DEFERRALS.** Grep `lib/features/` for `Phase X` before every commit.
4. **DO NOT guess.** `AskUserQuestion` for spec ambiguity / value decisions.
5. **Pre-alpha = break compatibility freely.** Tests follow code.
6. **Verify after EVERY fix.** analyzer + full tests + host widget tests
   driving the REAL controller/engine; emulator for native. Cohort per
   milestone / on `FIX_REQUIRED`.
7. **Write/update HANDOFF.md before the session ends.**
8. **Serial default; parallel only when truly orthogonal.** (Language-agent
   ARB translation is the one safe parallel task.)
9. **Co-Authored-By footer:** `Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.8 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>`.
10. **Pure Dart in `lib/domain/`, `lib/services/protocols/`, `lib/data/`.**
11. **lefthook re-stages auto-fixes. NEVER `dart format .` / `import_sorter`
    REPO-WIDE** — scope to changed files. A multi-line `show` flutter import
    oscillates with format — use a bare `import 'package:flutter/x.dart';`.
    After `gen-l10n`, KEEP the regenerated `app_localizations*.dart` when you
    added a key (verify the diff is additions-only).
12. **Pushing to `main` needs explicit user authorization each time.**

---

## Emulator (the verification standard)

```bash
export ANDROID_HOME=/home/jonas/Android/Sdk
export PATH="$ANDROID_HOME/emulator:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools:$PATH"
adb devices    # an emulator-5554 may still be up from a prior session
# If not booted, cold-boot headless (AVD Pixel_9_Pro / API 36 pre-exists):
emulator -avd Pixel_9_Pro -no-window -no-audio -no-boot-anim \
  -gpu swiftshader_indirect -no-snapshot &
until [ "$(adb shell getprop sys.boot_completed 2>/dev/null | tr -d '\r')" = 1 ]; \
  do sleep 3; done; adb shell input keyevent 82
# Run an integration test (wrap in `timeout` — a hung test won't self-kill):
timeout 480 flutter test integration_test/app_boot_smoke_test.dart -d emulator-5554
```
First Gradle build ~30–75 s (incremental is fast). **Don't** pipe a long
backgrounded `flutter test` through `| tail` (buffers → no output until exit);
redirect to a file with `>` instead.

---

## Quick verification commands

```bash
flutter analyze --fatal-infos                                   # 0 issues
flutter test --concurrency=6                                    # 3708 pass
dart format <changed .dart files>                              # changed files only
grep -rnE "(Phase 8|Phase 9|Phase 10|Phase 11)" lib/features/  # 0
git status --porcelain -- OLD/                                  # empty
flutter gen-l10n                                                # after any ARB change
# l10n parity spot-check (each new key in all 14 ARBs):
for k in <newKey>; do echo "$k: $(grep -l "\"$k\"" lib/l10n/l10n/app_*.arb | wc -l)/14"; done
```
lefthook pre-commit runs `dart format` + `import_sorter` (re-stages);
pre-push runs `flutter analyze --fatal-infos` + `flutter test`.

## The plan + task journal

- **Plan doc:** `docs/rewrite/ga-wiring-remediation.md` (gap inventory §2 =
  tasks #8–#23, method §3, milestones M0–M5 §4).
- **Milestones:** **M0 ✓ pushed. M1 ✓ pushed. M2 IN PROGRESS** — #13a ✓ +
  #13b ✓ + #14 ✓ + #13c ✓ done (UNPUSHED); remaining **#13d (save validation)
  → #23 (alarm settings) → #20 (channel validation / SMS template / iOS
  warnings) → M2 cohort → push.** Then M3 (#15 stealth), M4
  (#10/#9/#8/#16 + Tier-F), M5 (Phase-9: INT scenarios, device e2e incl.
  #11 adb-gsm + #12 background-throttle, spec-coverage matrix, coverage floor).
  The in-memory TaskList is cleared on `/clear` — this bullet is the durable
  journal.

---

## End-of-session ritual (every session)

1. **Update HANDOFF.md** — snapshot, what changed, decisions, next action.
2. **Commit HANDOFF.md** (`…-handoff: …` + Co-Authored-By footer).
3. **Tell the user the resume prompt** exactly: `Continue from HANDOFF.md`.

Don't skip it because "the session went short."

---

End of hand-off. M0+M1 verified+pushed; **M2 config-UI in progress** — #13a +
#13b (per-step config) + #14 (SMS contact grid) + #13c (Safety Options)
committed, UNPUSHED. Resume by **building #13d (save validation) → #23 → #20
→ M2 cohort → push.**
