|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Home widget interactivity** | YES | YES (iOS 17+) / PARTIAL (iOS 16) | — | Android: full interactive AppWidget (Quick Exit broadcasts to a Dart interactivity callback, Fake Call deep-links to `/fake-call`). iOS 17+: SwiftUI WidgetKit extension with `AppIntent`-based interactive buttons (`QuickExitIntent`, `FakeCallIntent`). iOS 16 fallback: same widget surface but buttons rendered as `Link(destination:)` deep-links (`guardianangela://quick-exit`, `guardianangela://fake-call`); tapping launches the host app at the appropriate route and the app completes the action. Both platforms ship at v3 GA per spec audit D14. |
| **Status line (live)** | YES | YES | — | `"Idle"`, `"Session active"`, `"Simulation active"`, `"Battery alert"` plus an `mm:ss` elapsed timer. Updated on every engine event from `SessionController`. |

---

## Hardware Buttons

Requires wired or Bluetooth headphones with media button. Android headphone remote not implemented (volume buttons preferred). |
| **Headphone Remote — Rapid Press** | N/A | YES | — | iOS only: 2–10 presses of headphone remote within configured window |
| **Headphone Remote — Long Press** | N/A | NO | — | iOS: not supported via `audio_service` media button callbacks (no ACTION_DOWN/UP timing available) |

---

## Background Execution

| Feature | Android | iOS | Permission | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Foreground Service** | YES | Limited | START_STICKY, FOREGROUND_SERVICE | Android: persistent service with notification, auto-restart after kill. iOS: no direct equivalent; uses background modes (audio, location, voip). |

| **Biometric Auth (Face ID)** | NO | YES | USE_BIOMETRIC | Not available on Android (no reliable face recognition API). iOS: full Face ID support. |
| **App PIN** | YES | YES | — | 4–8 digit PIN (length chosen at setup per-PIN; `AppSettings.pinLength` removed) to unlock app at launch. No biometric. |
| **Session End PIN** | YES | YES | — | PIN required to disarm or end active session. Biometric may substitute. 15s timeout. |
| **Duress PIN** | YES | YES | — | Third PIN: enters at any prompt → silently fires the mode's resolved distress mode (`SessionMode.distressModeId` → `AppDefaults.defaultDistressModeId`). No error message shown. |
| **Simulation Mode (SMS/calls blocked)** | YES | YES | — | SMS, phone calls, emergency calls, loud alarm audio, audio recording all blocked / muted (logged as `sim_blocked`). Fake call, vibration, reminders fire normally. |
| **Encryption at Rest** | YES | YES | — | AES-256 via `sqlite3mc` (Drift DB) + AES-256 envelope on JSON-backed singleton/list repositories; encryption key generated on first launch and stored in `flutter_secure_storage` (Android Keystore / iOS Keychain). |

---

## Data Storage & Backup

| Feature | Android | iOS | Permission | Notes |

| **Manual JSON Import** | YES | YES | — | User-initiated import with merge or replace options |
| **Backup Schema Versioning** | YES | YES | — | Export includes `_schemaVersion`; import validates compatibility |
| **JSON Repository Corruption Recovery (Extra 21)** | YES | YES | — | If `JsonRepositories.init()` throws (e.g., malformed JSON or unreadable encryption envelope), `main()` runs the minimal `JsonRecoveryApp` widget offering "Start fresh" (deletes the JSON directory and re-seeds) or "Restore from backup" (stages a backup file for next launch). After either action, the user relaunches the app to boot into a healthy storage state. |

## Platform-Specific Limitations & Workarounds

### Android Advantages
1. **SMS auto-send**: SmsManager sends directly without user interaction
2. **Full background execution**: AlarmManager, StartSticky service, exact timers
3. **App kill recovery**: Watchdog detects and recovers
4. **Volume button detection**: Fully supported
5. **System volume override**: Can force media stream to max

### iOS Limitations (Documented)
1. **SMS**: Opens Messages app; user must press Send button
2. **Emergency call**: Confirmation dialog required (user must tap)
3. **Volume button detection**: Not supported (volume buttons not interceptable on iOS; greyed out in settings)
4. **Headphone remote**: Partial — only the central play/pause button, only repeat-press pattern, only when headphones are connected (C1)
5. **Background timers**: Approximate only (OS may delay up to 10 min)
6. **App kill detection**: Launch-time only (no background restoration)
7. **No resume after force-close**: Session prompts user on next launch; does not auto-resume (Extra-13)
8. **Foreground service**: No persistent background notification
9. **App permissions**: Cannot be granted programmatically (user goes to Settings)

### Workarounds & Mitigations
1. **iOS SMS limitation**: Educate users during onboarding; show warning before SMS step
2. **iOS call limitation**: Make confirmation countdown prominent; pre-call SMS alerts contact
3. **iOS volume button**: Disable and grey out in settings; document as unsupported
4. **iOS headphone remote (C1)**: Presented as alternative check-in for iOS; requires headphones; warn users in settings
5. **iOS background timers**: Accept approximate timers; avoid long sleep durations
6. **Critical alerts**: Require Apple entitlement request; warn users (may be rejected)

## Testing Across Platforms

| Aspect | Testing Approach | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Session timers** | Both platforms identically | Same logic, same behavior |
| **Fake calls** | Visual verification | Screenshots for Android and iOS |
| **SMS/calls** | iOS: manual confirmation | Android: auto-send verification |
| **Notifications** | Both platforms | System notification behavior |
| **Background execution** | Android: watchdog only | iOS: launch-time detection |
| **Location** | Both: mock GPS in tests | Real GPS in field testing |
| **Biometric** | Both: biometric mock in tests | Real unlock in manual testing |

## Future Platform Support

### Web (Not Planned)
- Would require refactoring for web-specific APIs
- No SMS/call APIs available
- Consider if commercial demand warrants
- Estimated effort: 8 weeks

### Desktop (macOS/Windows) (Not Planned)
- Currently out of scope
- Would require platform-specific service implementations
- Consider if user base demands
- Estimated effort: 10 weeks

### Android Wear / watchOS (Future)
- Could provide quick check-in or emergency button on smartwatch
- Requires separate app distribution
- Lower priority; evaluate user feedback first
